# Predict-Survivability-of-Patients-with-Diabetes
This study conducted an approach to predict the ICU survivability of patients with diabetes within the first 24 hours of their admission. A variety of data, such as patient demographic details, data related to ICU stays, laboratory test results taken within 24 hours of admission, and chronic health conditions were used in the analysis. 

Specifically, this study constructed the work toward achieving three research objectives:
• To predict the survivability/mortality of patients with diabetes in ICUs
• To find the best ML model for predicting ICU survivability under diabetes conditions
• To identify factors that are important in predicting survivability under diabetes conditions at ICUs.
